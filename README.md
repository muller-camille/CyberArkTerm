**Multi-session Windows client for CyberArk.** CyberArkTerm signs in to your PVWA, lists the accounts you can access
and opens your sessions with a double-click: remote desktop through **PSM**, or an SSH terminal through **PSM for SSH
(PSMP)** with a built-in **file browser** to upload files to the server.

## Features

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **CyberArk sign-in** | CyberArk, LDAP, RADIUS (challenge / OTP included) or Windows (current session) authentication. |
| **Available** | Every account visible in the vault, grouped by safe, platform or target type, with instant search; password actions (CPM, copy), safe members, adding, editing and importing accounts. |
| **My servers** | Your working servers, organized in folders and subfolders, each with its own settings. |
| **PSM sessions** | Remote desktop through the PSM (like the PVWA "Connect" button), in Windows Remote Desktop Connection: component, target machine, reason, ticket. |
| **SSH sessions (PSMP)** | Built-in terminal in a tab (xterm compatible: colours, vim, less, top…), MFA, right-click menu, search, separate windows. |
| **Files tab** | SFTP browser of the server: drag-and-drop upload (SCP or SFTP) and download, SHA-256 check of every file, transfer queue and history, sortable columns, editing in your text editor, permissions, live following (`tail -f`), comparison, sending to several servers. |
| **Parallel view** | Up to 8 SSH sessions side by side (a "My servers" folder opens in one click), optional simultaneous typing. |
| **Emergency access (KeePass)** | Without CyberArk: KeePass vaults (.kdbx) in "My servers", direct SSH and remote desktop connections, local log. |
| **Languages** | English, French and Italian: Windows language by default, can be changed at any time. |

## Installation

### Download the executable

1. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/muller-camille/CyberArkTerm/releases/latest) in the
   repository's *Releases*.
2. Download **`CyberArkTerm-<version>-win-x64.zip`** and unzip it (the SHA256 hash is in
   `SHA256SUMS.txt`).
3. Run `CyberArkTerm.exe`: a single file, no runtime to install, no administrator rights needed.

Development builds: the executable of every build is also available as the `CyberArkTerm-win-x64`
artifact in the [Actions](https://github.com/muller-camille/CyberArkTerm/actions/workflows/build.yml) tab.

The executable is not signed: on first launch, Windows SmartScreen may show a warning
("More info" → "Run anyway").

### Update

Settings button → **"About CyberArkTerm…"**: version, project links, settings folder, and "Check now". When a newer
version exists, "Download and check" saves the archive to the Downloads folder, then compares it with `SHA256SUMS.txt`
of the same version (kept only when identical). Nothing is installed automatically: close CyberArkTerm and replace
the executable; your settings are kept. The option "Look for a new version at startup" (off by default) does this
check at most once a day and shows a link in the status bar.

### Requirements

**Workstation**

- Windows 10 or 11 (x64).
- The Windows Remote Desktop client (installed by default): Remote Desktop Connection (`mstsc`) for PSM sessions,
  its built-in control for direct remote desktop from KeePass vaults.
- Optional: Windows Terminal and the Windows "OpenSSH Client", only if you choose to open SSH outside
  CyberArkTerm.

**CyberArk side**

- PVWA **v10 or later** (REST API `/PasswordVault/API/...`), reachable over **HTTPS** with a certificate
  trusted by the workstation.
- **List accounts** permission on the relevant safes: the application only shows what the API lets you see.
- PSM configured on the platforms you use (`PSM-RDP`, `PSM-SSH`… components).
- For SSH: a **PSM for SSH (PSMP)**, with SFTP allowed for the Files tab (and SCP for SCP uploads).
- Optional: **MFA caching** enabled on the PVWA, so you do not type your password and MFA again at the PSMP.

## Getting started

1. **Sign in**: PVWA address (`pvwa.mydomain.local` is enough), authentication method, user name and password. The
   address, method and user name are remembered; the password never is.
2. **Find an account** in the "Available" tab: the search box filters on every field (`prd sql`). Right-click an
   account for its password (verify, change, reconcile, copy), the members of its safe, or to add, edit and import
   accounts.
3. **Connect** with a double-click: a Windows account opens a PSM session in Remote Desktop Connection; a Unix account
   opens an SSH terminal in a tab, through the PSMP set in **Settings**. Right-click in the terminal for copy, paste,
   search and the tab actions.
4. **Files tab** (next to an SSH session): browse the server, drag files from Explorer to upload them, drag them to
   Explorer to download them. Each file is checked (SHA-256); the **History** button of the toolbar keeps every
   transfer and its checksums. Click a column header to sort.
5. **My servers**: keep your working servers in folders, each with its connection settings (PSM or SSH, component,
   target machine, start folder); open a whole folder in the **parallel view**.
6. **Emergency access**: when CyberArk is unavailable, "Emergency access (KeePass)" on the sign-in window opens your
   KeePass vaults and connects directly over SSH or remote desktop (not recorded by the PSM, logged on this computer).

The **[user guide](docs/guide.md)** describes every tab in detail, the
[shortcuts](docs/guide.md#shortcuts), the [settings and configuration file](docs/guide.md#settings-and-configuration-file),
[how it works](docs/guide.md#how-it-works) and [troubleshooting](docs/guide.md#troubleshooting).

## Security

- **HTTPS required** to the PVWA; certificate validation is never disabled.
- **No secret on disk**: CyberArk password, session token, MFA key and PSMP password stay in memory; the PVWA session
  is closed on exit. The configuration file holds no password, token or private key.
- **Standard CyberArk sessions**: PSM and PSMP sessions opened by CyberArkTerm are recorded and audited by the PSM like
  the ones opened from the PVWA.
- **Copied passwords** go straight to the Windows clipboard, kept out of its history and synchronization, and are
  cleared after 20 s; they are never shown nor logged.
- **PSMP host keys** are pinned on first use, with a warning if they change.
- **KeePass vaults**: the master password is never saved, except in the local vault if you ask for it (Argon2id,
  AES-256-GCM, protected by your Windows account); every opening and connection is written to a local log.
- **No request to the Internet** without your action or the update option (off by default); a downloaded update is
  kept only if its SHA-256 matches `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and nothing is installed automatically.
- **Debug log** off by default; it never contains a password, token or session content.

[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) (private reporting, no public issue).

## Development

### Structure

| Project | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/CyberArkTerm.Core` | Cross-platform logic without UI: PVWA API client, account classification, xterm terminal emulator, PSMP connections and SFTP/SCP browser (SSH.NET), "My servers" folders, KeePass vaults (KDBX), local vault, preferences. |
| `src/CyberArkTerm.App` | WPF application: windows, tabs, terminal control, Remote Desktop control (RDP tabs), `mstsc` launch, icon (`Assets`). |
| `tests/CyberArkTerm.Core.Tests` | xUnit tests of Core (fake PVWA over HTTP, terminal, PSMP, folders, translations…). |
| `tests/CyberArkTerm.App.Tests` | Windows tests of the application (real Remote Desktop control, DPAPI). |

External dependency: [SSH.NET](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET) (MIT license).

### Translations

Interface texts live in `src/CyberArkTerm.Core/Localization/CoreStrings*.resx` and
`src/CyberArkTerm.App/Localization/Strings*.resx`: English in the neutral file, then `.fr` and `.it`.
The `*.Designer.cs` classes are generated by Visual Studio (`PublicResXFileCodeGenerator`); a test checks that
every language has all the keys, the same `{0}` parameters and the same `_` access keys.
To add a language: copy the `.resx` files with the new code (`.de.resx`…), translate them, then add the code
to `UiLanguage.Supported`.

### Build and test

With the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0):

```powershell
dotnet test CyberArkTerm.sln
dotnet run --project src/CyberArkTerm.App
```

The project also builds on Linux or macOS (`EnableWindowsTargeting`); the application only runs on Windows.
The tests in `tests/CyberArkTerm.App.Tests` (including a test of the real Remote Desktop control) only run on
Windows; elsewhere, run `dotnet test tests/CyberArkTerm.Core.Tests`.

### Publish the executable

```powershell
# Self-contained (~65 MB): nothing to install on the workstation
dotnet publish src/CyberArkTerm.App -c Release -r win-x64 -p:SelfContained=true `
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -o publish

# Lightweight: requires the ".NET Desktop Runtime 10" on the workstation
dotnet publish src/CyberArkTerm.App -c Release -r win-x64 -p:SelfContained=false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o publish
```

CI ([`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml)) runs the tests and publishes the
self-contained executable as the `CyberArkTerm-win-x64` artifact for every pull request and every push to
`main`.

### Publish a release

From GitHub: **Actions → release → Run workflow** on `main`, with the `X.Y.Z` number; or push a `vX.Y.Z` tag
on `main`. The [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow runs the tests, builds the executable
with that version number, creates the tag if it does not exist and publishes the GitHub *Release* with the
zip and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Release notes are read from `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` when that file exists.

## Limitations and ideas

**Current limitations**

- **Privilege Cloud** (sign-in through CyberArk Identity) and **SAML** are not supported.
- The Accounts API does not say which PSM components a platform offers: the component is deduced, then can be
  remembered.
- KeePass vaults: Twofish encryption and YubiKey keys are not supported; no vault creation (create it with KeePass
  or KeePassXC); attachments are kept but not shown.
- Following the terminal folder requires bash, zsh or tcsh on the server.
- PSM Gateway (HTML5), dual control and exclusive access are not supported.

**Ideas**

- Signed executable and MSI installer.
- Several PVWAs (connection profiles), Privilege Cloud.
- Other ideas, kept for later: see [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md).
